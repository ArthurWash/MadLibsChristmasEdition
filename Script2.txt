'Twas the night before Christmas, with family through the house
Not an Adam was [verb ending in -ing], not even a Lucy
The [plural noun] were hung by the chimney with [singular adverb]
In hope that [infamous person] soon would be there;

The children were [verb ending in -ed] all snug in their  beds,
While visions of [noun] [verb ending in -ed] in their heads;
And Judy in her [clothing], and Nancy in her [clothing],
Had just settled our [body part, add an 's' at the end] for a long winter's nap,

When out on the lawn there arose such a [noise],
Rachel sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window Rachel [verb] like a(n) [animal],
Tore open the [noun] and threw up the [noun].

The [noun] on the [noun] of the new fallen [noun]
Gave the lustre of [adjective] to the [noun] below,
When, what to Taylor's [adverb] eyes should appear,
But a [adjective] sleigh, and eight tiny [animal],

With a [adjective] old driver, so [adverb] and [adverb],
Liz knew in a moment it must be [person].
More rapid than [animal] his coursers they came,
And he [verb ending in -ed], and shouted, and called them by name:

"Now, [person and/or pet]! Now, [person and/or pet]! Now, [2 people and/or pets]!
On, [person and/or pet]! On, [person and/or pet]! On, [2 people and/or pets]!
To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!
Now [verb] away! [verb] away! Dash away all!"

As [noun] that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with a [adjective], mount to the sky;
So up the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sliegh full of [plural noun], and [person from liz's part]

Merry Christmas to all!
